# **RealTimeData**

**Current Situation** 

apetito has a customer-facing application called myapetito which gets some of its data from SAP. This data is collected twice a day at 8pm and 2am from SAP and exported to a separate database. This means that data our customers see can often be out of date. This causes problems for them and has the knock-on effect of causing operational challenges for our teams in Portbury, both in customer services and distribution 

 

**The Challenge given**  

Find a way to get data out of SAP as changes are made, in real time, using any technologies you see fit so that customers always see the same data as our internal SAP users. 

Understand what data is shared between SAP and my apetito, its business purpose and how it moves from one application to the other.  

Analyse any existing solutions apetito have in place and determine how these could be improved to achieve the goal of real time updates.  

Having a full picture of the problem and shortfalls of existing solutions will put you in a great place to then start designing & building your proposed solution.  

As part of this project, you may need to create a proof of concept, refactor, or rewrite the integration or application to apply your solution above to this application.
